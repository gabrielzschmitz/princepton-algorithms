/*
  Program Description:
  --------------------
  This Java program, named RandomWord.java, reads a sequence of words from
  standard input and prints one of those words uniformly at random. It utilizes
  Knuthâ€™s method to achieve this, selecting a word with probability 1/i to be
  the champion as each word is read, replacing the previous champion.
  After reading all words, it prints the surviving champion.

  Implementation Details:
  -----------------------
  - Imports necessary classes from the algs4.jar library, including StdIn,
    StdOut, and StdRandom.
  - The main method serves as the entry point of the program.
  - Initializes variables champion and count to keep track of the current
    champion word and the total number of words read.
  - Reads words from standard input using StdIn.readString() and counts the
    number of words read.
  - Selects the current word as the champion with probability 1/count using
    StdRandom.bernoulli(1.0 / count).
  - Prints the surviving champion using StdOut.println(champion).

  Note: This program efficiently selects a random word without storing the
  words in an array or list, making it suitable for scenarios with large input
  streams or memory constraints.
